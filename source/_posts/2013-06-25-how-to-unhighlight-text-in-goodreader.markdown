It was not easy to figure out how to unhilghight text in GoodReader.

After trying every item of context menu on selected text, long touch and swipe on Annotations list, I consulted the Google.
I found a [Question](http://www.ipadforums.net/ipad-general-discussions/16730-questions-goodreader-app.html) but that didn't help me a lot.

It turned out that I just needed to single touch on the highlighted text. GoodReader finally showed me the context menu below.

That's it. It jsut did what's expected.
